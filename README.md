# LiriBot

Liri bot is a very simplified version of siri that can only look up song movies and what bands might be in town. This app uses several api and node packages in order to get it working.

It works going into the command line then calling node liri.js and then you have to input one of the comands:

    - concert-this ==> for concert information
    - spotify-this-song ==> for song information
    - movie-this ==> for movie information 
    - do-what-it-says ==> just a default 

Then after you choose you can search for the movie or song that you want and it will pass the information
